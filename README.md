# Bangla-Llama: A Family of LLaMA-based LLMs focused on Bangla Language

## Description

This repository contains the code and models for "Bangla-Llama", a project focused on enhancing the performance of language models for the Bangla language. It builds upon the open-source LLaMA model, introducing additional Bangla tokens and employing the LoRA methodology for efficient training. Please read the technical report for more details.

## Axolotl Configurations

The repository includes a set of configuration files for training and fine-tuning models using the Axolotl framework. These configurations are located in the `scripts/train/axolotl_configs` directory and are organized by model version and task type. Each configuration file specifies parameters such as the base model, datasets, training hyperparameters, and LoRA adapter settings.


## Results

The results from various models trained using these configurations are stored in the `results` directory. This directory contains evaluation metrics, model performance summaries, and comparison charts for different model versions and training setups.

These results provide insights into the effectiveness of different configurations and training strategies, helping to guide future model development and optimization efforts.



## Model Management and Evaluation Scripts

This repository contains a set of scripts designed for managing, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models, specifically focusing on language models. The scripts are organized to handle different tasks such as inference, evaluation, and pushing models to the Hugging Face Hub.

## Scripts Overview

### Inference Script

**File:** `scripts/inference/inference.py`

The inference script is designed to generate responses from a language model based on a list of questions provided in a CSV file. It supports dynamic loading of models and tokenizers, and logs the inference process.

**Key Features:**
- Loads a pre-trained language model and tokenizer.
- Generates responses for each question in the input CSV.
- Supports retry logic for generating responses.
- Logs the inference process and saves results to a CSV file.

### Evaluation Analysis Script

**File:** `scripts/gpt4_eval_analysis/gpt4_eval_analysis.py`

This script merges two CSV files containing model evaluation results and calculates average and min-max scores for model evaluations. It is useful for analyzing the performance of different models on a set of tasks.

**Key Features:**
- Merges evaluation results from two CSV files.
- Calculates average and min-max scores for each category.
- Saves the analysis results to CSV files.

### Model Push Script

**File:** `scripts/push_model/push.py`

The model push script is used to upload a fine-tuned model to the Hugging Face Hub. It handles the merging of model adapters and ensures the model is properly configured before uploading.

**Key Features:**
- Loads and merges model adapters.
- Saves the merged model and tokenizer.
- Pushes the model to a specified Hugging Face repository.

### Evaluation Script

**File:** `scripts/gpt4_eval/eval.py`

This script is used to evaluate the responses of two large language models (LLMs) for the same instruction. It scores the responses on a scale of 1-100 and provides detailed reasoning for the scores. The script rotates through a list of models to avoid rate limits and saves the results in a CSV file.

**Key Features:**
- Evaluates and scores model responses.
- Rotates through a list of models to handle rate limits.
- Saves results to a CSV file and a pickle backup.

## Usage
